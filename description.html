		<h1 class="descriptionh1">Why we want to go to the Superbowl</h1>
		<p>First off who doesn't want to go to the Superbowl, if they watch football.  Just being able to say "I was there when the Bills or Patriots won!" We both grew up watching the games, rooting for our teams to climb to the top and bring home the championship.  One of us has had far more opportunities than the other as far as our teams are concerned. Robert's team the Buffalo Bills haven't seen a playoff in over a decade.  Kyle's team the New England Patriots seem to make the big game every other year.  All of Robert's brothers have been to a Superbowl in the past, leaving him as the odd man out in his family.  Kyle has had his team in the game but never been granted an chance to see it in action.</p>
